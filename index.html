                     <p>
                        The HCA Index or Slave Ship Database project is a web application for searching and indexing historical records from the parliamentary papers specifically HCA 35 (house of commons volume 35) which detail the fates of slave ships and the captives on them that were captured by the British royal navy. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The records themselves are 19th-century ‘copperplate’ – a style of clerical writing – written by trained scribes where the court adjudications took place. As a small note, many of the court adjudications were of mixed commission because the ships were flying under many different national flags but were captured under the legal pretense of treaties that the British signed with European maritime powers. This is an early instance of formalized international maritime law. 
                  </p>

                     <h2>background</h2>
                     <p>
                        This web application was made at the behest of Dr. Mathew Hopper at Cal Poly. One of professor Hopper’s main fields of research is the transatlantic slave, and in one of his upper division classes, students first learn about the slave trade from a variety of primary sources (notably the memoir of Olaudah Equiano who experienced the slave trade as a captive). Then, in the second half of the course, students pick one Ship and read through the 19th century copperplate record of the ships capture, captives, and adjudication. Students write a term paper on their chosen ship to cap off the course.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        I took this class in winter of 2021, and chose to write about the Charles, and Dutch ship captured with 264 souls on board. However, picking the ship was an affair that involved sifting through a clumsy excel document with thousands of manual entries. I saw the potential for a proper database system to enable students and Professor Hopper to quantitatively analyze the records, and for students to filter and pick out interesting ships to research.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can see my paper on <i>The Charles</i> <li class=nav ><a class=nav href="/Papers.html">here</a></li></p>

                     <h2>Course of the Database Project</h2>
                     <p>Starting in Spring 2022, Ryan Linard and I started working on this project, picking up from an attempt by previous Cal Poly CS student. The previous project was a good starting off point and helped us create a framework for future development but had major performance and architecture issues.</p>
                     <p>The main customer of the project would be Professor hopper and his students so we tailored the project to match their use case. The web application has two main user-facing parts: the search page and the volume browser. The volume browser was added later and build off work I did for the searching functionality to enable students to simply explore the whole database in a manageable way. </p>
                     
                     <img class=responsive-image src="slaveShipDatabase/volume_browser.png" alt="volume browser">
                     <p class="caption">splitting up the data into volumes reflects how the data are physically laid out in the primary source material – and splits the data up into manageable chunks.</p>

                     <p>I spent most of my time building the search page. The previous iteration of this project by the previous student had a single search field that would try to autocomplete on each letter the user typed in – and in the process queried the entire database on each keystroke! This system was not very well suited for the users of this database, who needed a more filter-style search system. 
                        Accordingly, I implemented a search system that allows for the user to filter on each of the 20 or so attributes that each ship has (there are many ships with incomplete data, as this data was handwritten in the 19th century.) I also created a results table that showed a subset of relevant attributes, and a detail page for each entire were the entire set of attributes can be viewed. </p>

                     This Project was made for CSC 471 at Cal Poly in fall quarter 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  For my final project, I created two floating islands, and asteroid in blender, and put them together in a kinematics model to orbit each other. My initial idea was to model something like the three-body problem, with three bodies of roughly equal mass exerting orbital forces on each other. Due to time constraints, it proved impractical to find an initial stable configuration to model. Therefore, I decided to model a more traditional orbital system with one body having a dominant amount of mass. In this project that body is the largest island.
               </p>
               <p>
                  For this project I made sure to implement technically challenging features but making a visually appealing and cohesive scene was very important to me, hence the decision to create most of the models.

                  Collisions are implemented as perfectly elastic, using vector math. A collision occurs when the distance between two bodies is less than or equal to the sum of their radii. When a collision occurs, the vector normal of collision is computed. Then the dot product of the difference in velocities and the vector normal of collision is computed to get the relative velocity of the bodies along the vector normal of collision. This relative velocity is subtracted and added to the velocities of the bodies, and then mass weighting is applied.

                     Each body has a radius, mass, position, velocity, and acceleration. These, along with the gravitational constant, are initially set manually to create a stable system. When the model runs, the acceleration is computed according to Cowell’s method (for Orbit Modeling) and velocity and position are set accordingly. This was implemented such that all the bodies exert gravitational force on each other. In practice however, the motions of the bodies are mostly determined by the largest island as it had the largest mass by far.

                     The snow falling from the cloud onto the large island is what constitutes the particle system.

                     I implemented Blinn-Phong lighting for this project with ambient, diffuse, and specular components. There is a light source attached to the large island and a second light source attached to the smaller island.

                     I also implemented texture mapping on the trees, lantern, and tank. As a note, the tank turret is animated to rotate side to side and the lantern’s animated to become brighter and dimmer.

                     This project was made for the 'SLO hacks go' hackathon in November 2019.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     During this project, I worked with three other team members to create a program to help quantitatively analyze wastewater during the wastewater treatment process. Specifically, the goal of this program was to measure the “mixed liquor quality” with computer vison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     “Mixed liquor quality” refers to how much solid biomass still mixed in with the wastewater in an aeration tank. The wastewater plant we were dealing with used the “active sludge” method for filtering wastewater, which consists of an aeration tank, at which point air is injected into the wastewater, and a settling tank, where the water “settles” and the biomass physically separates from the wastewater, with only clear, treated water remaining.

                  <p class=body>
                     At the start of the project, we drove over the SLO wastewater treatment plant to learn more about the wastewater treatment process from the workers at the plant, and to collect data in the form of videos of the water in the aeration tank.

                  <h2 class=body>Writing the Computer Vision Program</h2>
                  <p class=body>
                     The computer vision program first converted the input video into the HSV color space, to improve image segmentation and make the system more robust against varying light levels. The program then used a simple threshold to segment the bubbles from the water and calculated the percent of the frame that was covered by water.  Then, the average color of the water was computed. I attempted to implement a way to calculate the size of the individual bubbles by matching the bubbles with textures through key points, but was not able to due to time constraints.

                     We displayed our project as a combination of raw video of the wastewater, a visualization of the program’s segmentation, and a website to display the computed data.

                  <p class = body>
                     I worked on this project with Jasmine D, Linnea Holmen, and John Yee.
                  </p>
                  <p class = body>
                     I worked with OpenCV in C++ to process video and get relevant quantitative information from video footage of wastewater in a tank where it is treated. Jasmine D was the industry expert that helped identify the problem and provided access to the information we used in our demo. Linnea Holmen worked on the ideation process, the final presentation, and finding ways to simply explain the complicated process of wastewater treatment. John Yee created the web page which read the data and displayed it in an easy-to-read table.
